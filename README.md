## Project Description
The purpose of the "About Me" Project was to be introduced to various web development, HTML and CSS (Hypertext Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets respectively) concepts and to gain experience employing them in the creation of a page about myself.

### Things learned along the way...
During this project, some of the things (truncated) I learned were:
* Styling of HTML pages using CSS rather than outdated style tags.
* Correct usage of Flexbox for page layout design.
* Creation and styling of forms, navigation aids and hover states.
* Consideration of accessibility and perception difficulties in page design, notation and styling.

### Final touches...
During this final stage of development, I replaced elements which were originally occupied by placeholders, added distinct style differentiations for mobile and desktop experiences, some hover states and animated elements.

### Blog Post
A blog post about the subject of z-index stacking has been added with a description of how the CSS property comes into use as well as visual examples for demonstration.  Sources for information and example code are below in the citations section.

### The Nav Bar
A navigation bar with different media states for desktop and mobile users is located at the top of the page.  For mobile users, a compact and animated (during toggling open and closed) hamburger menu is used for navigation.  For desktop users, the Nav Bar buttons are made visible and statically accessible across the top of the page.  

## Color Scheme
For the page color scheme, I selected shades of blue which would be inviting and relaxing to guests as well as provide appropriate contrast for those with color perception difficulties.  Two tan tones were also prepared with appropriate consideration for contrast for potential alternative or future use.  Below is a graphical chart showing the prepared color palette and further down are the code values for each color.
